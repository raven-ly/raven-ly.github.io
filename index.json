With only a basic computer setup, access to high-end rendering pipelines was not feasible.\nMy Unique Approach In Mirror, I explored various ways to use visual language to tell a compelling story—not just for aesthetics, but to deepen emotion and narrative impact. Through experimentation, I found that toon shading combined with line art in an NPR (non-photorealistic rendering) environment using Blender was the sweet spot. This approach not only reduced rendering time but also aligned beautifully with the film’s surreal and stylized tone.\nTexture Contrast I wanted to create a visual environment with texture contrast—juxtaposing smooth, clean surfaces with more jittery, paper-like textures to emphasize mood and visual rhythm, just like I did in my illustrations. This contrast helps reinforce the mood and visual rhythm of the film, amplifying its dreamlike atmosphere.\nAnimation Illustration Illustration Reverse Lighting I experimented with toon shading, but intentionally avoided replicating Japanese anime styles or hyperrealistic Western 3D aesthetics. Instead, I developed a hybrid style that emphasizes how characters interact with light.\nOne unconventional decision: I created \u0026ldquo;reverse lighting\u0026rdquo; effects, where the character’s face appears darker under a spotlight. This produced an eerie, otherworldly feel—perfect for a film that plays with themes of illusion and unreality. In the Blender NPR (non-photorealistic rendering) community, this kind of light manipulation is still quite rare, so it felt like an exciting new territory.\nReverse Lighting (Hard) Reverse Lighting (Soft) Reverse Lighting w Line Texture Reverse Lighting - Environment Camera movement Additionally, I adopted camera techniques inspired by documentaries—including handheld movements and imperfect pans—to create a raw, observational feel. This approach reinforced the illusion that viewers were witnessing a surreal game show or social experiment, intensifying emotional tension through both framing and motion.\n","date":1750032000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1750032000,"objectID":"8e5380adf8674f7a4d167683cb010bad","permalink":"/post/mirror/","publishdate":"2025-06-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mirror/","section":"post","summary":"Table of Contents Challenge My Unique Approach Texture Contrast Reverse Lighting Camera movement Mood change based on color Toon-Stylized Character Design What I\u0026rsquo;ve learned Verdict Credits Challenge Creating Mirror involved three major constraints:","tags":["animation"],"title":"The Making of Mirror (While Being Frugal)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0129250eef935a39002fa25292cb0d27","permalink":"/animation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/animation/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9030b401186ae79421a53eb8a6d7364b","permalink":"/cat/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cat/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"/home/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a5217405c50261376aeae5bc2155e9f1","permalink":"/illustration/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/illustration/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
